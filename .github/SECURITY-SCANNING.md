# Security Scanning and Quality Gates

This document describes the security scanning and quality gates implemented in the CI/CD pipeline for the Next-Dev project.

## Security Scanning Tools

The pipeline uses multiple security scanning tools to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### 1. npm audit

- **Purpose**: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Configuration**: Runs in production mode to focus on production dependencies
- **Quality Gates**:
  - Critical vulnerabilities will cause the pipeline to fail
  - High severity vulnerabilities are reported but don't block the pipeline

### 2. Snyk Security Scanning

- **Purpose**: Provides deeper vulnerability detection beyond npm audit
- **Configuration**: Configured to detect high and critical severity issues
- **Quality Gates**:
  - Runs in continue-on-error mode to collect information
  - Results are reported in the build summary

### 3. CodeQL Static Analysis

- **Purpose**: Performs static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in the codebase
- **Configuration**: Uses the security-and-quality query suite for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Quality Gates**:
  - Critical security issues will cause the pipeline to fail
  - Results are automatically uploaded to GitHub Security dashboard

## Quality Gates Implementation

The pipeline implements the following quality gates:

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**:
   - Critical vulnerabilities in dependencies block the build
   - High severity vulnerabilities are reported but don't block the build

2. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - Critical security issues detected by CodeQL block the build
   - All results are available in the GitHub Security dashboard

3. **Build Dependencies**:
   - The build job depends on successful completion of:
     - Lint and test job
     - Security scan job
     - CodeQL analysis job

4. **Reporting**:
   - Security scan results are summarized in the build job
   - Detailed reports are available in the GitHub Security dashboard

## Viewing Security Reports

1. **GitHub Security Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to the "Security" tab in the repository
   - View CodeQL analysis results under "Code scanning alerts"
   - View dependency vulnerabilities under "Dependabot alerts"

2. **Build Summary**:
   - Each build includes a summary of security scan results
   - Shows counts of high and critical severity issues

## Handling Security Issues

When security issues are detected:

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - The pipeline will fail
   - Fix the issues before proceeding with deployment

2. **High Severity Issues**:
   - Review the issues in the build summary
   - Plan to address them in upcoming sprints

3. **False Positives**:
   - Document any false positives
   - Consider adjusting the security scanning configuration if needed
