# Contributing to NextDev

First off, thank you for considering contributing to NextDev! It's people like you that make NextDev such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues].
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (or the primary development branch).
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
6.  Issue that pull request!

#### Commit Messages

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for your commit messages. This allows for automated changelog generation.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Styleguide

- Follow the existing code style (e.g., indentation, variable naming).
- Run `npm run lint` to check for style issues.

Thank you!
