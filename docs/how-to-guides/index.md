# How-to Guides

Welcome to the how-to guides section of our documentation. These guides are task-oriented resources designed to help you solve specific problems when working with our Next.js project.

## What are How-to Guides?

How-to guides:
- Are task-oriented
- Address specific questions ("How do I...?")
- Provide practical steps to solve real-world problems
- Focus on results rather than concepts
- Assume some prior knowledge
