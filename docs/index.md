# Next.js Project Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for our Next.js project. This documentation follows the [Divio Documentation Framework](https://documentation.divio.com/), which organizes documentation into four distinct types to serve different user needs.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into four main sections:

### [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md)

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** resources designed to help beginners get started with the project. They provide step-by-step guidance to achieve specific outcomes while learning the basics of the system.

- Focused on learning by doing
- Designed for beginners
- Provide concrete steps with immediate results
- Build confidence through successful completion

### [How-to Guides](./how-to-guides/index.md)

How-to guides are **task-oriented** resources that help you solve specific problems. They assume you have basic knowledge of the system and focus on achieving particular goals.

- Address specific questions ("How do I...?")
- Provide practical steps to solve real-world problems
- Focus on results rather than concepts
- Assume some prior knowledge

### [Reference](./reference/index.md)

Reference documentation is **information-oriented** and provides technical descriptions of the system's components, APIs, and configuration options.

- Describes the system's machinery
- Structured around code
- Accurate and complete
- Focused on description, not instruction

### [Explanation](./explanation/index.md)

Explanation documents are **understanding-oriented** and provide background, context, and discussion about the system's architecture, design decisions, and concepts.

- Provides context and background
- Explains why things are designed the way they are
- Discusses alternatives and trade-offs
- Deepens understanding rather than providing practical steps

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started Tutorial](./tutorials/getting-started.md) to set up your development environment and build your first feature.

For specific tasks, check the [How-to Guides](./how-to-guides/index.md) section.
