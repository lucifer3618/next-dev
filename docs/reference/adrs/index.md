# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Next.js project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why use ADRs?

ADRs are used to document significant architectural decisions and their rationale. They provide several benefits:

1. **Historical record**: ADRs provide a historical record of decisions, helping new team members understand why the system is built the way it is.
2. **Decision transparency**: They make the decision-making process transparent and explicit.
3. **Future reference**: They serve as a reference when revisiting or reconsidering decisions.
4. **Knowledge sharing**: They help share knowledge across the team and organization.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded)
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The problem being addressed and relevant context
- **Decision Drivers**: Factors that influenced the decision
- **Considered Options**: Alternatives that were considered
- **Decision**: The chosen option and justification
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes of the decision
- **Related Documents**: Links to related documentation
- **Notes**: Additional information

2. [ADR-002: Server Components Architecture](./adr-002-server-components-architecture.md)
3. [ADR-003: Convex Database Integration](./adr-003-convex-database-integration.md)
4. [ADR-004: Authentication Strategy](./adr-004-authentication-strategy.md)

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

1. Copy the [template](./template.md) to a new file named `adr-XXX-title.md` where XXX is the next available number
2. Fill in the template with the details of your decision
3. Add the new ADR to the list in this index file
4. Submit the ADR for review and approval

For more details on the ADR process, see the [ADR Process Guide](./adr-process.md).
