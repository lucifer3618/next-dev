# ADR-003: Convex Database Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-03

## Context

Our application required a database solution that could support real-time updates, provide good developer experience, and scale with our application needs. We needed to decide on a database technology and how to integrate it with our Next.js application.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for real-time data synchronization
* Developer experience and ease of use
* Scalability requirements
* Integration with Next.js and React
* Data modeling flexibility
* Operational complexity
* Cost considerations

## Considered Options

* Firebase Firestore
* Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
* MongoDB with change streams
* Convex
* Custom solution with PostgreSQL and WebSockets

## Decision

Chosen option: "Convex", because:

1. It provides built-in real-time capabilities with automatic client updates
2. It offers a developer-friendly TypeScript API with end-to-end type safety
3. It has excellent integration with React through hooks and components
4. It handles scaling automatically without additional configuration
5. It provides a serverless model that aligns with our Next.js deployment strategy
6. It includes built-in authentication integration
7. It offers a generous free tier for development and small applications

## Consequences

### Positive

* Simplified real-time data synchronization without custom WebSocket implementation
* Improved developer experience with TypeScript integration and React hooks
* Reduced operational complexity with managed database service
* Automatic scaling without manual intervention
* Built-in optimistic updates for better user experience

### Negative

* Vendor lock-in to Convex's proprietary platform
* Limited control over database infrastructure
* Potential cost implications at scale compared to self-hosted solutions
* Learning curve for developers not familiar with Convex

### Neutral

* Different data modeling approach compared to traditional SQL databases
* Need to define schema and functions in Convex's format

## Notes

While Convex is a relatively new technology, its developer experience and real-time capabilities made it an attractive choice for our application. We will monitor its performance and cost as our application scales and reevaluate if necessary.
