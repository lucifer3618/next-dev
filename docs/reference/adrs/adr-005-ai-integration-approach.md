# ADR-005: AI Integration Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-05

## Context

Our application requires AI capabilities to enhance user experience and provide intelligent features. We needed to decide on an AI provider and integration approach that balances capabilities, cost, and implementation complexity.

## Decision Drivers

* AI capabilities required for our use cases
* Integration complexity
* Cost considerations
* Performance and latency
* Security and privacy
* Scalability
* Developer experience

## Considered Options

* OpenAI (GPT models)
* Google Gemini AI
* Anthropic Claude
* Hugging Face models (self-hosted)
* Custom fine-tuned models

## Decision

Chosen option: "Google Gemini AI", because:

1. It provides strong capabilities for our specific use cases
2. It offers a well-documented JavaScript SDK (@google/generative-ai)
3. It has competitive pricing compared to alternatives
4. It integrates well with our existing Google ecosystem
5. It provides good performance and reliability
6. It offers a server-side API that aligns with our security requirements
7. It supports multimodal capabilities (text, images) that we anticipate needing

## Consequences

### Positive

* Access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities
* Simplified integration through official SDK
* Potential cost savings compared to some alternatives
* Multimodal support for future feature expansion
* Good alignment with our existing Google services

### Negative

* Vendor lock-in to Google's AI ecosystem
* Potential privacy concerns with data processing
* Limited control over model behavior compared to self-hosted solutions
* Dependency on Google's API availability and pricing changes

### Neutral

* Need to implement proper API key management
* Regular updates to maintain compatibility with Gemini API changes
* Need to handle rate limiting and error cases

## Notes

We've implemented the Gemini AI integration using server-side API calls to protect our API keys and ensure proper usage monitoring. This approach also allows us to add caching, rate limiting, and other optimizations as needed.
