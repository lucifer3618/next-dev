# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Process

This document outlines the process for creating, reviewing, and managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in our Next.js project.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making a significant architectural decision that:

- Has a significant impact on the system
- Represents a choice between multiple viable alternatives
- Would be useful for future team members to understand
- Affects multiple components or teams
- Involves trade-offs that should be documented

Examples of decisions that warrant an ADR:

- Selecting a framework or major library
- Defining a data storage strategy
- Establishing an authentication approach
- Choosing a deployment strategy
- Defining API design principles
- Making significant changes to the application architecture

## ADR Lifecycle

ADRs follow a lifecycle with several statuses:

1. **Proposed**: The ADR is drafted and under discussion
2. **Accepted**: The ADR has been reviewed and accepted
3. **Deprecated**: The ADR is no longer relevant but is kept for historical purposes
4. **Superseded**: The ADR has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

1. Identify the need for an architectural decision
2. Copy the [template](./template.md) to a new file named `adr-XXX-title.md` where XXX is the next available number
3. Fill in the template with the details of your decision
4. Set the status to "Proposed"
5. Add the new ADR to the list in the [index file](./index.md)
6. Submit the ADR for review

## Reviewing an ADR

The review process for ADRs involves:

1. Sharing the proposed ADR with relevant stakeholders
2. Collecting feedback and addressing concerns
3. Revising the ADR as needed
4. Reaching consensus on the decision
5. Updating the status to "Accepted" once approved

## Updating an ADR

If a decision needs to be revised:

1. If the change is minor, update the existing ADR and note the change in a "Revision History" section
2. If the change is significant, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
3. Update the status of the old ADR to "Superseded" and reference the new ADR
4. Update the new ADR to reference the old ADR it supersedes

## ADR Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting from 001. Once an ADR is assigned a number, that number is never reused, even if the ADR is later deprecated or superseded.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow the standard format defined in the [template](./template.md). While the format provides a structure, feel free to adapt it as needed for specific decisions.

## Best Practices

When writing ADRs:

- Be concise and clear
- Focus on the decision and its rationale
- Document alternatives that were considered
- Be honest about trade-offs and consequences
- Use diagrams when they help clarify the decision
- Link to relevant documentation or resources
- Avoid technical jargon when possible
- Keep the ADR focused on a single decision
