## Date

## Context

Our team needed to select a web application framework for building a modern, performant, and scalable web application. The framework needed to support server-side rendering, static site generation, and modern React features while providing a good developer experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for server-side rendering and static site generation
* Performance requirements for initial page load and SEO
* Developer experience and productivity
* Community support and ecosystem
* Scalability and deployment options
* Support for modern React features

## Considered Options

* Next.js
* Remix
* Gatsby
* Create React App with custom server
* SvelteKit

## Decision

Chosen option: "Next.js", because:

1. It provides built-in support for both server-side rendering and static site generation
2. It has excellent performance characteristics with features like automatic code splitting
3. It offers a great developer experience with features like Fast Refresh
4. It has a large and active community with extensive documentation and examples
5. It integrates well with Vercel for deployment
6. It supports the latest React features including Server Components
7. It provides a file-system based routing system that is intuitive and easy to use

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved performance through server-side rendering and static site generation
* Enhanced SEO capabilities through server rendering
* Simplified routing through file-system based routing
* Improved developer experience with hot module replacement and other developer tools
* Access to a large ecosystem of plugins and examples
* Easy deployment to Vercel and other platforms
* Support for modern React features like Server Components

### Negative

* Learning curve for developers not familiar with Next.js
* Some constraints imposed by the Next.js framework and conventions
* Potential vendor lock-in with Vercel (though Next.js can be deployed elsewhere)

### Neutral

* Need to follow Next.js conventions and patterns
* Regular updates to keep up with Next.js releases

## Notes

We specifically chose Next.js 15 for this project to take advantage of the App Router and Server Components, which represent a significant improvement over the Pages Router in terms of performance and developer experience.
