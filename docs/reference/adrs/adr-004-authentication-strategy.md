# ADR-004: Authentication Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-04

## Context

Our application requires user authentication to provide personalized experiences and secure access to user data. We needed to decide on an authentication strategy that balances security, user experience, and development complexity.

## Decision Drivers

* Security requirements
* User experience considerations
* Development complexity and maintenance
* Integration with our technology stack
* Support for social login options
* Scalability and reliability
* Compliance requirements

## Considered Options

* Custom authentication system
* Auth0
* NextAuth.js / Auth.js
* Firebase Authentication
* Google OAuth direct integration
* Clerk

## Decision

Chosen option: "Google OAuth direct integration", because:

1. It provides a secure and well-established authentication mechanism
2. It simplifies the user experience by leveraging existing Google accounts
3. It has good integration with our Next.js and React stack through @react-oauth/google
4. It reduces development complexity compared to building a custom solution
5. It aligns with our user base, who are likely to have Google accounts
6. It has minimal cost implications (free for our expected usage)
7. It integrates well with our Convex database for user management

## Consequences

### Positive

* Simplified user onboarding through familiar Google login
* Reduced development time compared to custom authentication
* Strong security backed by Google's authentication infrastructure
* No need to manage user credentials or implement password reset flows
* Easy integration with our technology stack

### Negative

* Limited to users with Google accounts
* Some dependency on Google's authentication services
* Less control over the authentication flow compared to custom solutions
* Potential privacy concerns for users cautious about Google integration

### Neutral

* Need to implement proper token handling and session management
* Regular updates to maintain compatibility with Google's OAuth implementation

## Notes

While this decision limits authentication to Google accounts, we believe this is acceptable for our target audience. In the future, we may consider adding additional authentication providers if user feedback indicates a need for more options.
