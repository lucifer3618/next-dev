# ADR-002: Server Components Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-02

## Context

With the adoption of Next.js 15, we had the opportunity to use React Server Components, a new architecture for building React applications. We needed to decide how to structure our application using Server Components and Client Components, and how to balance server-side and client-side rendering.

## Decision Drivers

* Performance requirements, especially for initial page load
* User experience requirements for interactivity
* SEO requirements
* Data fetching patterns
* Bundle size considerations
* Developer experience and maintainability

## Considered Options

* Traditional client-side rendering with minimal server-side rendering
* Server-first approach with React Server Components as the default
* Hybrid approach with strategic use of both Server and Client Components
* Static-first approach with mostly static generation and client hydration

## Decision

Chosen option: "Server-first approach with React Server Components as the default", because:

1. It provides the best performance for initial page load by reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client
2. It simplifies data fetching by allowing components to directly access data sources on the server
3. It improves SEO by ensuring content is available in the initial HTML
4. It reduces client-side JavaScript bundle size
5. It aligns with Next.js 15's recommended patterns and best practices

Under this approach:
- Components are Server Components by default
- Client Components are used only when necessary for interactivity, state, or browser APIs
- Data fetching is primarily done on the server
- UI rendering starts on the server and is streamed to the client

## Consequences

### Positive

* Faster initial page load times due to reduced JavaScript
* Improved SEO through server rendering
* Simplified data fetching without client-side data fetching libraries
* Reduced client-side JavaScript bundle size
* Better performance on low-powered devices

### Negative

* New mental model for developers to learn and adapt to
* Some limitations on what can be done in Server Components (no hooks, no browser APIs)
* Potential for increased server load
* More complex debugging across server and client boundaries

### Neutral

* Need to carefully consider the boundary between Server and Client Components
* Different patterns for state management compared to traditional React applications

## Notes

This decision represents a significant shift in how we build React applications, moving from a primarily client-side rendering model to a server-first approach. We expect this to evolve as the React Server Components ecosystem matures and as we gain more experience with this architecture.
