# Authentication Issues Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where users are unable to sign in, sign out, or maintain their authenticated sessions, or when there are security concerns related to the authentication system.
- **Potential Impact**: Users unable to access the application, unauthorized access to user accounts, or loss of user session data.
- **Severity**: P1-P3 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- Users unable to log in
- Users being unexpectedly logged out
- Authentication errors in application logs
- Increased failed login attempts
- Session management issues
- OAuth callback errors
- Security alerts related to authentication

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - All users unable to authenticate<br>- Authentication security breach<br>- Unauthorized access to user accounts |
| P2 - High | - Significant subset of users unable to authenticate<br>- Intermittent authentication failures affecting many users |
| P3 - Medium | - Authentication issues affecting a small subset of users<br>- Minor security concerns requiring attention |
| P4 - Low | - Cosmetic issues in authentication flow<br>- Non-critical authentication warnings |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Developer familiar with authentication implementation
- **SMEs**: OAuth expert, security expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the authentication issue through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine the scope of affected users
- [ ] Check Google OAuth service status
- [ ] Verify OAuth credentials and configuration
- [ ] Check for recent deployments or changes that might have caused the issue
- [ ] Assess potential security implications
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review authentication-related logs for error patterns
- [ ] Check for expired or invalid OAuth credentials
- [ ] Verify redirect URIs and OAuth configuration
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect authentication
- [ ] Check for potential security incidents (unusual login patterns, brute force attempts)
- [ ] Verify environment variables related to authentication
- [ ] Test authentication flow in different environments

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For OAuth configuration issues:
- [ ] Update OAuth credentials or configuration
- [ ] Verify redirect URIs in Google OAuth console
- [ ] Update environment variables if necessary

#### For code-related issues:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment
- [ ] Fix authentication code issues
- [ ] Deploy fixes with proper testing

#### For security incidents:
- [ ] Temporarily disable affected authentication methods if necessary
- [ ] Reset compromised credentials
- [ ] Implement additional security measures
- [ ] Consider forcing re-authentication for all users

#### For external service issues:
- [ ] Contact Google support if OAuth service is experiencing problems
- [ ] Implement temporary alternative authentication method if possible

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure authentication flow is functioning correctly
- [ ] Update monitoring to better detect similar issues in the future
- [ ] Conduct security review if the incident had security implications

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the issue and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved
- [ ] If security was compromised, provide appropriate notifications and guidance

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Escalate to security team immediately if there are signs of a security breach

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents
- [ ] Update security protocols if necessary

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive testing for authentication flows
- Add specific synthetic monitoring for authentication
- Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Regularly rotate and audit OAuth credentials
- Monitor authentication failures and set up alerts for unusual patterns
- Maintain documentation of authentication dependencies and failure modes
- Implement security best practices for authentication

## 10. Reference Information

### Authentication Flow

The application uses Google OAuth for authentication with the following flow:
1. User initiates login
2. Application redirects to Google OAuth
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Google redirects back to application callback URL
5. Application verifies authentication and creates session

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_KEY` - OAuth client ID

### Logs and Monitoring

- Authentication logs
- OAuth callback logs
- Session management logs
- Security monitoring logs
