# API Service Disruption Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where one or more API endpoints are unavailable, returning errors, or experiencing significant performance degradation.
- **Potential Impact**: Users unable to perform actions that rely on API endpoints, data not being saved or retrieved, features not functioning correctly.
- **Severity**: P1-P3 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- HTTP 5xx errors from API endpoints
- Increased API response times
- Failed API requests in synthetic monitoring
- User reports of API-related functionality not working
- Error logs showing API failures
- Timeout errors when calling API endpoints

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - All API endpoints are down<br>- Critical API endpoints (authentication, AI features) are completely unavailable |
| P2 - High | - Multiple API endpoints are down<br>- Critical endpoints are degraded but partially functional |
| P3 - Medium | - Non-critical API endpoints are down<br>- Intermittent issues with API endpoints |
| P4 - Low | - Minor API performance degradation<br>- Issues affecting a small subset of users |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Backend developer familiar with API implementation
- **SMEs**: Next.js API routes expert, Vercel deployment expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the API disruption through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine which API endpoints are affected
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment status and logs
- [ ] Check for recent deployments or changes that might have caused the issue
- [ ] Assess the impact on users and dependent services
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review API logs for error patterns
- [ ] Check for increased error rates or latency
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect the API
- [ ] Verify environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Check external dependencies (Gemini AI, Convex database)
- [ ] Review server resources and potential scaling issues
- [ ] Check for potential security incidents (DDoS, unusual traffic patterns)

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For deployment-related issues:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment using the rollback workflow
- [ ] Verify API functionality after rollback

#### For configuration issues:
- [ ] Update environment variables or configuration
- [ ] Restart affected services

#### For dependency issues:
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms if external services are down
- [ ] Adjust timeouts or retry logic

#### For resource constraints:
- [ ] Scale up resources if necessary
- [ ] Implement rate limiting or throttling to manage load

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure all affected endpoints are functioning correctly
- [ ] Update monitoring to better detect similar issues in the future

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team via designated channel
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the issue and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Consider engaging external support if the issue involves third-party services

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive API testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Add more granular synthetic monitoring for critical API endpoints
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Set up proper rate limiting and throttling
- Ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Maintain documentation of API dependencies and failure modes

## 10. Reference Information

### Key API Endpoints

Based on the application architecture, the following API endpoints are considered critical:

- `/api/ai-chat` - AI chat functionality
- `/api/gen-ai-code` - AI code generation
- Authentication-related endpoints

### Logs and Monitoring

- Vercel deployment logs
- Application logs
- Synthetic monitoring results
