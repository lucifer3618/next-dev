# Incident Response Framework

This document outlines the incident response framework for the Next.js application. It provides a structured approach to handling incidents, from detection to resolution and post-incident analysis.

## 1. Incident Definition

An incident is any unplanned interruption or degradation of service that affects users or system functionality. Incidents can range from minor issues affecting a small number of users to major outages affecting the entire application.

## 2. Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into four severity levels:

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Time Target | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| P1 - Critical | Complete service outage or security breach affecting all users | Immediate (< 15 min) | < 2 hours | Production deployment is down for all users |
| P2 - High | Major functionality is impaired or a significant subset of users is affected | < 30 min | < 4 hours | AI features not working for all users |
| P3 - Medium | Minor functionality is impaired or a small subset of users is affected | < 2 hours | < 24 hours | Non-critical API endpoint returning errors |
| P4 - Low | Cosmetic issues or minor bugs with minimal user impact | < 24 hours | < 72 hours | UI styling issue on a specific browser |

## 3. Incident Response Team Roles

- **Incident Commander (IC)**: Coordinates the overall response, makes decisions, and ensures the team stays focused
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communications
- **Technical Lead**: Directs technical investigation and resolution efforts
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**: Provide specialized knowledge in specific areas (e.g., AI, database, frontend)
- **Scribe**: Documents the incident timeline, actions taken, and decisions made

## 4. Incident Response Process

### 4.1 Detection and Identification

Incidents can be detected through:
- Synthetic monitoring alerts
- User reports
- CI/CD pipeline failures
- Manual observation
- Security monitoring alerts

### 4.2 Declaration and Classification

Once an incident is detected:
1. The person who detects the incident becomes the initial Incident Commander
2. The IC assesses the severity and declares an incident
3. The IC assembles the appropriate response team based on the incident type
4. The incident is logged in the incident tracking system

### 4.3 Investigation and Diagnosis

1. The technical team investigates the root cause
2. The team gathers relevant logs, metrics, and other diagnostic information
3. The team identifies affected components and potential solutions

### 4.4 Containment and Mitigation

1. Implement immediate actions to contain the incident and prevent further impact
2. Apply temporary fixes or workarounds to restore service
3. Monitor the effectiveness of mitigation actions

### 4.5 Resolution

1. Implement permanent fixes to resolve the incident
2. Verify that the resolution addresses the root cause
3. Confirm that all affected services are functioning correctly

### 4.6 Post-Incident Activities

1. Conduct a post-incident review (PIR) within 48 hours of resolution
2. Document lessons learned and action items
3. Update playbooks and monitoring based on findings
4. Implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents

## 5. Communication Guidelines

### 5.1 Internal Communication

- Use dedicated incident communication channels (e.g., Slack channel)
- Provide regular status updates (frequency based on severity)
- Document all actions and decisions in real-time
- Maintain clear, concise communication focused on facts

### 5.2 External Communication (Users/Stakeholders)

- Acknowledge the incident promptly
- Provide regular updates on status and expected resolution time
- Be transparent about the impact while avoiding technical jargon
- Communicate when the incident is resolved and what steps were taken

## 6. Incident Documentation

For each incident, document:
1. Incident summary and timeline
2. Root cause analysis
3. Actions taken
4. Resolution
5. Lessons learned
6. Action items to prevent recurrence

## 7. Specific Incident Playbooks

Detailed response procedures for specific types of incidents are available in the following playbooks:

- [Service Outage Playbook](./service-outage.md)
- [Data Breach Playbook](./data-breach.md)
- [Security Vulnerability Playbook](./security-vulnerability.md)
- [API Service Disruption Playbook](./api-disruption-playbook.md)
- [AI Service Failure Playbook](./ai-service-playbook.md)
- [Authentication Issues Playbook](./authentication-playbook.md)
- [Database Issues Playbook](./database-playbook.md)
- [Frontend/UI Failures Playbook](./frontend-playbook.md)
- [Performance Degradation Playbook](./performance-playbook.md)
- [Deployment Failure Playbook](./deployment-playbook.md)

## 8. Tools and Resources

- **Monitoring**: Synthetic monitoring, Lighthouse CI
- **Logs**: Vercel logs, application logs
- **Communication**: Slack, email
- **Incident Tracking**: GitHub Issues
- **Documentation**: Markdown files in the repository

## 9. Training and Drills

The team should conduct regular incident response drills to ensure everyone is familiar with the process and playbooks. These drills should simulate different types of incidents and test the team's ability to respond effectively.

## 10. Continuous Improvement

The incident response framework and playbooks should be reviewed and updated regularly based on:
- Lessons learned from actual incidents
- Changes to the application architecture
- New types of incidents
- Feedback from the team
