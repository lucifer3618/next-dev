# Deployment Failure Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where there are issues with deploying new code to any environment, resulting in failed deployments, partial deployments, or deployments that introduce regressions or new bugs.
- **Potential Impact**: Application unavailability, feature regression, or introduction of new bugs affecting user experience.
- **Severity**: P1-P3 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- Failed CI/CD pipeline builds
- Failed Vercel deployments
- Post-deployment application errors
- Regression in functionality after deployment
- Unexpected behavior in newly deployed features
- Monitoring alerts after deployment
- Failed synthetic monitoring checks after deployment

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - Production deployment failure causing complete outage<br>- Deployment introduces critical security vulnerability |
| P2 - High | - Production deployment with major functionality broken<br>- Preview deployment completely failing for extended period |
| P3 - Medium | - Production deployment with minor issues<br>- Preview deployment partially failing |
| P4 - Low | - Non-critical issues in preview deployments<br>- Build warnings or minor configuration issues |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Developer familiar with deployment process
- **SMEs**: CI/CD expert, Vercel deployment expert, infrastructure expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the deployment issue through CI/CD logs or Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Determine which environment is affected (preview, production)
- [ ] Check for build errors or deployment logs
- [ ] Verify if the application is partially or completely unavailable
- [ ] Assess the impact on users
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline logs
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment logs
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might cause deployment issues
- [ ] Verify environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Check for external dependencies that might affect deployment
- [ ] Verify if the issue is related to infrastructure or code

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For failed builds:
- [ ] Fix build errors in the codebase
- [ ] Update dependencies if necessary
- [ ] Adjust build configuration

#### For failed deployments:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment using the rollback workflow
- [ ] Verify application functionality after rollback
- [ ] Fix deployment configuration issues

#### For post-deployment issues:
- [ ] Identify the specific changes causing problems
- [ ] Implement hotfixes for critical issues
- [ ] Consider feature flags to disable problematic features

#### For infrastructure issues:
- [ ] Contact Vercel support if necessary
- [ ] Adjust infrastructure configuration
- [ ] Consider alternative deployment strategies

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure deployment process is functioning correctly
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline if necessary
- [ ] Verify application functionality after resolution

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of deployment issues and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Escalate to Vercel support for platform-related deployment issues

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update deployment process and documentation
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive pre-deployment testing
- Add deployment previews for all changes
- Implement canary deployments or progressive rollouts
- Set up proper monitoring for post-deployment issues
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms
- Maintain documentation of deployment process and dependencies
- Implement feature flags for risky changes

## 10. Reference Information

### Deployment Process

The application uses:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for hosting and deployment
- Preview deployments for development branches
- Production deployments for main branch

### CI/CD Pipeline

Key steps in the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Code quality checks
2. Unit and integration tests
3. Build process
4. Deployment to appropriate environment

### Environment Variables

Critical environment variables for deployment:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Token for Vercel deployment
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` - Public environment variables
- Various API keys and secrets

### Logs and Monitoring

- GitHub Actions workflow logs
- Vercel deployment logs
- Application logs
- Synthetic monitoring results
