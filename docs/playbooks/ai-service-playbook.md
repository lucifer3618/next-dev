# AI Service Failure Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where the application's AI features (chat, code generation) are unavailable, returning errors, or producing incorrect or unexpected results.
- **Potential Impact**: Users unable to use AI-powered features, receiving incorrect AI responses, or experiencing significant delays in AI responses.
- **Severity**: P1-P3 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- Errors when using AI chat or code generation features
- Timeouts when making requests to AI services
- Incorrect or nonsensical AI responses
- Increased latency in AI feature response times
- Error logs related to Gemini API calls
- Failed AI-related tests in synthetic monitoring

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - All AI features are completely unavailable<br>- AI features returning harmful or inappropriate content |
| P2 - High | - AI features are significantly degraded<br>- Major accuracy issues affecting user experience |
| P3 - Medium | - Intermittent AI service issues<br>- Minor accuracy or performance issues |
| P4 - Low | - Cosmetic issues with AI responses<br>- Slight degradation in response quality |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Developer familiar with AI integration
- **SMEs**: Google Gemini API expert, Next.js API routes expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the AI service failure through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine which AI features are affected (chat, code generation, etc.)
- [ ] Check Gemini API status (if available)
- [ ] Verify API key and authentication status
- [ ] Check for recent deployments or changes that might have caused the issue
- [ ] Assess the impact on users
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review logs for AI-related errors
- [ ] Check for API rate limiting or quota issues
- [ ] Verify environment variables related to AI services
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect AI integration
- [ ] Test AI service directly using API testing tools
- [ ] Check for changes in the Gemini API that might require updates
- [ ] Verify network connectivity to Google's services

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For API key or authentication issues:
- [ ] Rotate API keys if necessary
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Verify proper storage and usage of API keys

#### For rate limiting or quota issues:
- [ ] Implement request throttling
- [ ] Optimize API usage to reduce unnecessary calls
- [ ] Consider upgrading service tier if consistently hitting limits

#### For integration issues:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment
- [ ] Update integration code to accommodate API changes
- [ ] Implement fallback responses for critical features

#### For content safety issues:
- [ ] Implement or adjust content filtering
- [ ] Temporarily disable affected features if necessary

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure all AI features are functioning correctly
- [ ] Update monitoring to better detect similar issues in the future

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the issue and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Consider engaging Google support if the issue involves Gemini API

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive testing for AI features
- Add specific synthetic monitoring for AI endpoints
- Implement graceful degradation for AI features
- Set up proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Monitor API usage and set up alerts for approaching limits
- Maintain documentation of AI service dependencies and failure modes
- Implement fallback responses for critical AI features

## 10. Reference Information
