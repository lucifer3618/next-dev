# Frontend/UI Failures Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where users experience issues with the application's user interface, client-side functionality, or rendering, affecting the user experience and interaction with the application.
- **Potential Impact**: Poor user experience, inability to interact with the application, visual defects, or non-functional UI components.
- **Severity**: P1-P4 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- UI rendering errors or visual defects
- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Unresponsive UI elements
- Client-side functionality not working
- Inconsistent behavior across browsers
- Slow page load times
- Failed frontend tests in synthetic monitoring
- User reports of UI issues

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - Complete UI failure for all users<br>- Critical user flows blocked by UI issues |
| P2 - High | - Major UI components not functioning<br>- Significant subset of users experiencing UI issues |
| P3 - Medium | - Non-critical UI components not functioning<br>- UI issues affecting specific browsers or devices |
| P4 - Low | - Minor visual defects<br>- UI inconsistencies with minimal functional impact |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Frontend developer familiar with the UI implementation
- **SMEs**: React expert, Next.js expert, CSS/Tailwind expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the frontend/UI issue through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine which UI components or pages are affected
- [ ] Check for browser-specific or device-specific issues
- [ ] Verify if the issue is related to recent deployments or changes
- [ ] Assess the impact on users and critical user flows
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review browser console logs for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Check for CSS or styling issues
- [ ] Verify client-side state management
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect the UI
- [ ] Test across different browsers and devices
- [ ] Check for performance issues affecting UI rendering
- [ ] Verify that required assets (JS, CSS, images) are loading correctly

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For deployment-related issues:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment
- [ ] Verify UI functionality after rollback

#### For code-related issues:
- [ ] Implement hotfixes for critical UI bugs
- [ ] Deploy fixes with proper testing

#### For asset loading issues:
- [ ] Verify CDN configuration
- [ ] Check for missing or corrupted assets
- [ ] Update asset references if necessary

#### For browser-specific issues:
- [ ] Implement browser-specific workarounds
- [ ] Add polyfills for missing browser features

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure UI is functioning correctly across all supported browsers and devices
- [ ] Update testing to better catch similar issues in the future

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the issue and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available (e.g., use a different browser)
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior frontend developers if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Consider engaging UX/UI design team for complex interface issues

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update testing and monitoring
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive frontend testing (unit, integration, visual regression)
- Add cross-browser and responsive design testing
- Implement proper error handling for client-side errors
- Set up synthetic monitoring for critical user flows
- Implement graceful degradation for UI components
- Maintain documentation of UI components and dependencies
- Implement feature flags for risky UI changes
