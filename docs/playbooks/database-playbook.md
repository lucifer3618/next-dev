# Database Issues Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where the application experiences issues with data storage, retrieval, or integrity, affecting the functionality that depends on database operations.
- **Potential Impact**: Data loss, corruption, or unavailability; features dependent on database operations not functioning correctly.
- **Severity**: P1-P3 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- Database query errors in application logs
- Slow database response times
- Data inconsistency or corruption
- Failed database operations
- Increased error rates for database-dependent features
- Timeout errors when accessing data
- Synthetic monitoring alerts for database-dependent features

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - Complete database service outage<br>- Data corruption affecting critical functionality<br>- Security breach involving database |
| P2 - High | - Significant database performance degradation<br>- Partial data unavailability affecting major features |
| P3 - Medium | - Intermittent database issues<br>- Minor data inconsistencies<br>- Performance issues affecting non-critical features |
| P4 - Low | - Isolated database errors<br>- Minor performance degradation<br>- Issues affecting a small subset of users |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Developer familiar with database implementation
- **SMEs**: Convex database expert, data modeling expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the database issue through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine which database operations are affected
- [ ] Check Convex service status (if available)
- [ ] Verify database credentials and configuration
- [ ] Check for recent deployments or changes that might have caused the issue
- [ ] Assess the impact on users and data integrity
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review database-related logs for error patterns
- [ ] Check for database connection issues
- [ ] Verify database schema and recent changes
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect database operations
- [ ] Check for potential data corruption or integrity issues
- [ ] Verify environment variables related to database configuration
- [ ] Assess database performance metrics if available

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For connection issues:
- [ ] Verify and update database credentials if necessary
- [ ] Check network connectivity to Convex services
- [ ] Update environment variables if necessary

#### For performance issues:
- [ ] Optimize inefficient queries
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [ ] Consider scaling database resources if available

#### For data integrity issues:
- [ ] Identify affected data
- [ ] Restore from backup if necessary
- [ ] Implement data validation and correction procedures

#### For service outages:
- [ ] Contact Convex support if service is experiencing problems
- [ ] Implement temporary alternative data storage if possible
- [ ] Consider implementing read-only mode for critical features

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure database operations are functioning correctly
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Update monitoring to better detect similar issues in the future

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the issue and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved
- [ ] If data was affected, provide appropriate notifications

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Escalate to Convex support if the issue involves their service

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents
- [ ] Review and update data backup and recovery procedures

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive testing for database operations
- Add specific synthetic monitoring for database-dependent features
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Regularly review and optimize database queries
- Monitor database performance and set up alerts for degradation
- Maintain documentation of database schema and dependencies
- Implement regular data backup and validation procedures

## 10. Reference Information

### Database Architecture

The application uses Convex as its real-time database with the following key characteristics:
- Real-time data synchronization
- Document-based data model
- Serverless architecture

### Key Database Collections

Based on the application architecture, the following database collections are critical:
- Users
- Workspaces
- Projects
- AI Chat History

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment identifier

### Logs and Monitoring

- Database operation logs
- Query performance logs
- Error logs related to database operations
- Synthetic monitoring results for database-dependent features
