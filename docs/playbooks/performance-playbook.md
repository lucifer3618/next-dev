# Performance Degradation Playbook

## 1. Incident Overview

- **Description**: This playbook addresses incidents where the application experiences significant slowdowns, increased latency, or resource utilization issues that affect the user experience or system stability.
- **Potential Impact**: Poor user experience, timeouts, slow page loads, unresponsive UI, or system instability.
- **Severity**: P1-P4 depending on scope and impact.

## 2. Symptoms and Detection

- Increased page load times
- Slow API response times
- High server CPU or memory usage
- Increased error rates due to timeouts
- Degraded user experience reported by users
- Performance metric alerts from monitoring systems
- Failed performance thresholds in synthetic monitoring
- Poor Lighthouse scores

## 3. Severity Assessment

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| P1 - Critical | - Application is unusably slow for all users<br>- Complete system instability due to resource exhaustion |
| P2 - High | - Major features experiencing significant performance degradation<br>- Performance issues affecting a large subset of users |
| P3 - Medium | - Noticeable but not severe performance degradation<br>- Performance issues affecting specific features or user segments |
| P4 - Low | - Minor performance degradation with minimal user impact<br>- Performance issues in non-critical paths |

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response
- **Technical Lead**: Developer familiar with application performance
- **SMEs**: Next.js performance expert, infrastructure expert, database expert
- **Communications Lead**: Handles user communications

## 5. Response Steps

### 5.1 Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] Confirm the performance issue through synthetic monitoring or manual testing
- [ ] Determine which parts of the application are affected
- [ ] Check system resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- [ ] Verify if the issue is related to recent deployments or changes
- [ ] Check for unusual traffic patterns or potential DDoS
- [ ] Assess the impact on users and critical user flows
- [ ] Declare incident severity and assemble the appropriate team

### 5.2 Investigation (15-60 minutes)

- [ ] Review performance metrics and logs
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Check for slow database queries
- [ ] Verify API response times
- [ ] Examine recent code changes that might affect performance
- [ ] Check for external service dependencies that might be slow
- [ ] Analyze resource utilization patterns
- [ ] Review caching configuration
- [ ] Check Lighthouse reports for performance issues

### 5.3 Containment and Mitigation (30-90 minutes)

#### For deployment-related issues:
- [ ] Roll back to the last known good deployment
- [ ] Verify performance after rollback

#### For resource constraints:
- [ ] Scale up resources if possible
- [ ] Optimize resource-intensive operations
- [ ] Implement or adjust rate limiting

#### For database performance issues:
- [ ] Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Add or adjust indexes
- [ ] Implement query caching

#### For frontend performance issues:
- [ ] Optimize client-side rendering
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Optimize asset loading

#### For external dependency issues:
- [ ] Implement timeouts and circuit breakers
- [ ] Cache external service responses
- [ ] Reduce dependency on slow external services

### 5.4 Resolution

- [ ] Implement and verify permanent fixes
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Ensure performance is restored to acceptable levels
- [ ] Update monitoring to better detect similar issues in the future

## 6. Communication Plan

### Internal Communication:
- [ ] Provide regular updates to the incident response team
- [ ] Document all actions taken and their results
- [ ] Share findings with the development team

### External Communication:
- [ ] Notify users of the performance issues and expected resolution time
- [ ] Provide workarounds if available
- [ ] Update users when the issue is resolved

## 7. Escalation Procedures

- Escalate to senior technical staff if resolution is not progressing after 1 hour
- Escalate to management if incident reaches 2 hours without resolution
- Consider engaging infrastructure or platform support for severe performance issues

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review
- [ ] Document root cause and resolution
- [ ] Identify preventive measures
- [ ] Update performance testing and monitoring
- [ ] Implement improvements to prevent similar incidents

## 9. Preventive Measures

- Implement comprehensive performance testing
- Add performance budgets to CI/CD pipeline
- Set up detailed performance monitoring
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Implement auto-scaling for resources when possible
- Maintain documentation of performance requirements and bottlenecks

## 10. Reference Information

### Performance Metrics

Key performance metrics to monitor:
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- API response times
- Database query times
- Server resource utilization

### Performance Optimization Techniques

- Server-side rendering for initial page loads
- Static generation for content that doesn't change frequently
- Incremental Static Regeneration for content that changes occasionally
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Efficient state management
- Proper caching strategies

### Logs and Monitoring

- Performance monitoring metrics
- Resource utilization logs
- Slow query logs
- API response time logs
- Lighthouse reports
- Synthetic monitoring results
