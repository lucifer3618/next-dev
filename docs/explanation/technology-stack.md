**Library**: @google/generative-ai (0.24.0)

**Why we chose it**:
- State-of-the-art language model capabilities
- Simple API for integration
- Good documentation and examples
- Competitive pricing
- Alignment with our use cases

**Alternatives considered**:
- **OpenAI API**: Similar capabilities but different pricing model
- **Anthropic Claude**: Strong safety features but less developer-focused
- **Hugging Face models**: More control but requires more infrastructure
- **Local models**: No API costs but limited capabilities

## UI Components

### Radix UI

**Version**: Various (1.1.x - 2.1.x)

**Why we chose it**:
- Unstyled, accessible components
- Excellent keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Highly customizable with Tailwind CSS
- Lightweight and modular
- Strong TypeScript support

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Chakra UI**: More styled but less customizable
- **Material UI**: More opinionated design system
- **Headless UI**: Similar approach but less comprehensive
- **Shadcn UI**: Built on Radix but with more styling opinions

## State Management

### React Context + Hooks

**Why we chose it**:
- Built into React with no additional dependencies
- Sufficient for our current state management needs
- Simple mental model for developers
- Integrates well with server components
- Avoids unnecessary abstraction

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Redux**: More powerful but more complex
- **Zustand**: Simpler than Redux but still an additional dependency
- **Jotai/Recoil**: Atom-based approach with more granular updates
- **TanStack Query**: Excellent for server state but overkill for simple state

## Testing

### Jest + React Testing Library

**Version**: Jest 29.7.0, @testing-library/react 16.3.0

**Why we chose it**:
- Industry standard for testing React applications
- Encourages testing user behavior rather than implementation details
- Simple API for writing tests
- Good integration with Next.js
- Comprehensive mocking capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Vitest**: Faster but less mature
- **Cypress Component Testing**: Better visual testing but slower
- **Playwright Test**: End-to-end focused but can be used for component testing
- **Storybook + Jest**: Combination for visual testing and unit testing

## Deployment

### Vercel

**Why we chose it**:
- Created and maintained by the same team as Next.js
- Optimized for Next.js applications
- Simple deployment process with Git integration
- Global CDN for fast content delivery
- Built-in analytics and monitoring
- Generous free tier for development

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Netlify**: Similar features but less optimized for Next.js
- **AWS Amplify**: More AWS integration but more complex
- **Google Cloud Run**: More control but more configuration
- **Self-hosted**: Maximum control but higher maintenance burden

## Development Tools

### ESLint

**Version**: 9.x

**Why we chose it**:
- Industry standard for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- Highly configurable with many plugins
- Good integration with Next.js
- Helps maintain code quality and consistency

### Husky

**Version**: 9.1.7

**Why we chose it**:
- Manages Git hooks for pre-commit and pre-push checks
- Ensures code quality before commits
- Simple configuration
- Prevents bad code from entering the repository

### Commitlint

**Version**: 19.8.0

**Why we chose it**:
- Enforces consistent commit message format
- Integrates with conventional commits standard
- Enables automated changelog generation
- Improves repository history readability

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Performance vs. Developer Experience

We've prioritized both performance and developer experience:
- Next.js and React provide a good balance of performance and DX
- Tailwind CSS offers rapid development while maintaining performance
- Server components reduce client-side JavaScript while maintaining component model

### Flexibility vs. Standardization

We've aimed for a balance of flexibility and standardization:
- Radix UI provides unstyled components that can be customized
- ESLint and Prettier enforce code standards while allowing flexibility
- Project structure follows Next.js conventions while allowing for organization

### Build vs. Buy

We've made strategic decisions about building vs. buying:
- Using Convex instead of building our own real-time database solution
- Leveraging Google OAuth instead of implementing custom authentication
- Using Gemini AI instead of training our own models
- Building custom UI components on top of unstyled primitives

## Future Technology Considerations

As the project evolves, we're considering:

- **TypeScript Migration**: Moving from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety
- **Monorepo Structure**: Adopting a monorepo approach for better code sharing
- **Micro-frontends**: Exploring micro-frontends for larger scale applications
- **Edge Functions**: Leveraging Vercel Edge Functions for performance-critical operations
- **WebAssembly**: Exploring WebAssembly for compute-intensive operations
