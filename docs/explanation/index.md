# Explanation Documentation

Welcome to the explanation section of our documentation. This section provides background, context, and discussion about the system's architecture, design decisions, and concepts.

## What is Explanation Documentation?

Explanation documentation:
- Is understanding-oriented
- Provides context and background
- Explains why things are designed the way they are
- Discusses alternatives and trade-offs
- Deepens understanding rather than providing practical steps

## Using the Explanation Documentation

This explanation documentation is designed to provide deeper insights into the project's architecture, design decisions, and underlying concepts. It's meant to help you understand the "why" behind the "how" and "what" of the system.

If you're looking for practical instructions on how to accomplish specific tasks, please refer to the [How-to Guides](../how-to-guides/index.md) section. If you need detailed technical information about specific components or APIs, check out the [Reference](../reference/index.md) section. If you're new to the project and want to learn the basics, start with the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) section.
